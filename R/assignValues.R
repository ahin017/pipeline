# purpose: I have run into the problem of how to redefine arguements when a pipeline reuses modules.
# The module should be generic and not constrained to runnig one set of arguements...

# The question is, how can this assign the values as the pipeline runs?....

# Is there an event listener for function calls?

# maybe this is better done in another language....
